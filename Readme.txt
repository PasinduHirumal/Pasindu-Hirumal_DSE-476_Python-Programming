Text-Based Finance Tracker

Overview
This project is a text-based finance tracker implemented in Python. It allows users to manage their expenses and
income through a console interface. The system supports recording new entries, viewing all entries,
calculating totals, viewing a summary of transactions for a specific month, and persistently saving and
loading financial data.

Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.

How to Run
1. First of all you want to install python
2. After that open cmd (command prompt) and type "pip install matplotlib"
3. If there is a setup that can run this file, use it to open this file and run it easily.
4. If there is no such settings, open cmd (command prompt) and then enter the relevant file and press enter button.
5. After that, while in that path, specify "FinanceTrackerEnv\Scripts\activate" and press enter button.
6. Then type "python finance_tracker.py" and press enter button.

Features
- Record a new income or expense entry.
- View all recorded entries.
- Calculate total income and total expenses.
- View a summary of transactions for a specific month.
- The pie chart displayed when viewing all entries here summarizes all the data you have collected in a month as a percentage.
- Save and load financial data to and from a text file.

Additional Information
- Entries are saved in a file named `financial_data.txt`.
- Input validation is implemented to ensure the user enters valid data.

Optional Features
- File handling: The program uses file handling to store financial data persistently.
- Additional challenges: Error handling for file operations

Challenges faced
1. Lack of knowledge about libraries.
2. Problem handling errors.

Implemented solutions to challenges
1. Visited the library through YouTube videos and found details through web pages.

3. Discussing some errors with my friends.
2. In error handling, AI assistance was taken to figure out what made the code difficult to solve.
